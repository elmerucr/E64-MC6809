# E64

![E64](./docs/E64_icon_156x156.png)

## General Description

E64 is a computer system that runs on macOS and linux. It's mainly inspired by the Commodore 64 but uses the Motorola 6809 cpu (big endian) and implements some Amiga 500 and Atari ST technology as well.

* [MC6809](https://github.com/elmerucr/mC6809) cpu running at 4.8MHz able to access 16mb shared video ram using an SN74LS612 memory management unit.
* VIDEO chip with a resolution of 512x288 pixels and a palette of 4096 colors (12bit) running at 60Hz. After each screen refresh, it can raise an IRQ request.
* BLITTER chip with alpha blending capabilities and 16mb video ram.
* Sound:
	* Four SID chips (MOS 6581). Each individual SID chip runs at 985248Hz for the same pitch as the chips in the original C64 pal version. Emulation is achieved with the excellent [reSID](http://www.zimmers.net/anonftp/pub/cbm/crossplatform/emulators/resid/index.html) library by Dag Lem. Registers are remapped to enable big endian systems.
	* Four Analog Sound Devices capable of pure sinusoidal sound next to all common other sound waves.
	* Stereo mixing capabilities for all components.
* Eight independent and programmable timers connected to IRQ.

## Screenshots

Below the startup screen with command ```m 0800 0840``` that inspects a piece of io memory at ```$0800```.

The second screenshot shows debug mode after pressing F9. The virtual machine is frozen and can be run step by step.

## Usage

### Some Keyboard Shortcuts

* ```ALT+Q``` quits application
* ```ALT+W``` start/stop wav file output to settings directory
* ```ALT+R``` resets the system
* ```ALT+S``` turns embedded scanlines on/off
* ```ALT+F``` switches between fullscreen and window
* ```F9``` switches between normal and debug mode
* ```F10``` switches on screen stats on/off (visible in normal mode)

## Technical Specifications

### VIDEO and BLITTER

### SID Chips

For the big endian mapping, see picture below. It is adapted from the original Commodore datasheet.

### TIMERS

## Compiling

### macOS

* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
* Install the [SDL2 framework](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) development library to /Library/Frameworks
* Open the Xcode project in the ./E64 folder and build the application

### Ubuntu Linux / Debian

Run the following commands in a terminal:

````console
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libsdl2-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/elmerucr/E64
$ cd E64 && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
````

Finally, to run the application from the build directory:

````console
$ ./E64
````
